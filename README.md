# HLFixes
This is a hack for GoldSrc that aims to fix some bugs.

## Bugs fixed
- gl_overbright not functioning
- Music stopping when a level transition occurs
- Quick save history not functioning

## Running
Run `Injector.exe` while a GoldSrc game is running to fix the bugs. The fixes are only temporary and will go away if the game is restarted.
